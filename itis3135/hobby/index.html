                Welcome to my Midterm homepage. My goal for this assignment is to hopefully push you away from poorly constructed mechanical keyboards, or even worse, laptop keyboards...
                That beautiful keyboard above is one of the nicest keyboards made to date, likewise, it carries a hefty pricetag. Keycults can run easily into the thousands. However, there are
                a lot of affordable options that are very high quality. I hope after going through my assignment, I at least partiallity intrigued you into look deeper into this hobby and
                community.

                There's not really much I'd like to about myself. I'm just a guy trying to get through school pace who may or may not be creating a website about mechanical keyboards.
                at a reasonable pace.

                I first became interested in custom keyboards around 1 or 2 years ago. After being introduced to the custom mechanical keyboard scene, I became extremely dissatisfied 
                with the feel and sound of my corsair board at the time. A keyboard which many enthusiasts, including myself, would consider poorly made and criminally overpriced. 
                These "gamer" brands focus only on marketing while spewing out mass produced garbage with no room for customization. Especially in today's market, where the custom keyboard
                hobby is growing rapidly, there are countless budget boards that rival "gamer" brand keyboards in price while being of much higher quality with high customizability.

                For those who want to get into the hobby or just searching for more information, r/MechanicalKeyboards is a decent place to start. However, you will find much more information
                in vendor discords or from youtube channels. Make sure you are able to tell genuine information apart from advertisement though. On the plus side, many of the "bought" youtubers
                are purchased from "gamer" brands anyways which won't really affect you when trying to learn about the custom keyboard market. A good place to start is c/TaehaTypes or c/AndyVNguyen.

            <p>
                When getting started, there is quite a large learning curve. You absolutely should not make a purchase initially without first doing sufficient research. This is
                crucial as many entering the hobby may purchase mismatching parts or mistake a group buy for in-stock units. Many keyboards and keycap sets start with a group buy phase,
                in which customers will order and pay for the unit and recieve it later down the line at a specified date. Keyboards are often sold with a lead time of a few weeks to a few months,
                while many highend keycap sets can take up to 2 years. That is why research is critical. Don't let the long lead times push you away as there are many high quality affordable options
                that are in-stock or doing waves of in-stock runs each month in today's market.

                Those in the Computer Science field likely spend a minimum of 50 hours per week using a keyboard. The difference in typing experience is very apparent between a bad mechanical keyboard or
                laptop keyboard compared to a nice custom. With all of this time spent utilizing a keyboard each week, why not invest in making your experience more enjoyable?
