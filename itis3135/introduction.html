            <h2> About me </h2>
            <p> "The world hates change, yet it is the only thing that has brought progress."-Charles Kettering.
                <ul>
                    <li>PERSONAL: Born in Chicago then moved to Raleigh, NC when I was 9. Lived there until moving to Charlotte to attend university. </li>
                    <li>PROFESSIONAL: Worked at a moving company between high school and college. Currently work part time in a factory. </li>
                    <li>ACADEMIC: Started college at 23 and attended Wake Tech for two years before transferring to UNC Charlotte. Currently have an Associate in Science degree and working towards my B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. </li>
                    <li>PROGRAMMING/SOFTWARE: Grew up with a Windows PC and an iMac. Have been using strictly Windows for the past 15 years or so. I hope to never own another Apple product but pursuing a career in CS may change that. Most of my programming experience is in Java although Iâ€™ve also had classes in Python and C++. </li>

                    <li>STORY/ITEM: I once mistook a bottle of simple syrup as hand sanitizer at a cafe. As a bit of an OCD clean freak, I still have nightmares about it. </li>
