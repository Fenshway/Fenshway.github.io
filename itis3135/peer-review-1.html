            <ul>
                <li>Home page</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The homepage on first impression looks very well made. The logo in the top left with the centered menu bar looks very clean and allows for
                        efficient naviagation.</li>
                    <li>Below the menu, the skyline image that extends the width of the page with the business name and motto centered in the image looks professionally designed.</li>
                    <li>The spacing of the conents below the skyline image could use some work. There is not enough whitespace between the heading "Find a Psychologist" and the 
                        content below it.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>About</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The menu top margin is different from the homepage which should be changed.</li>
                    <li>The content located in the 3 sub-headings is broken up into a grid style which is a great design choice.
                        However, like the home page, this page suffers from not having enough white space between the content and headings.</li>
                    <li>The footer bottom margin differs from the home page.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>FAQ</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The FAQ page menu is the same as the home page menu which is very good. Not sure what went wrong with the about menu.</li>
                    <li>The information is stored in an interactive dropdown system which is well implemented.</li>
                    <li>The footer formatting is consistent with the home page.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Professionals</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inconsistencies with header and footer margins.</li>
                    <li>Spacing issues but otherwise well designed.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Application</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inconsistencies with header and footer margins.</li>
                    <li>The size of the form looks a bit small and awkward on larger screens. Not sure if this is an issue; just an observation.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Payment</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inconsistencies with header and footer margins.</li>
                    <li>This page seems to have the appropriate content but needs some css work in regard to spacing.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Contact</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inconsistencies with header and footer margins.</li>
                    <li>Form has appropriate content but could be sized larger.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <p>Justin has a great website so far. He implemented many professional design elements in the home and FAQ pages. I believe his focus from here
            should be directed at CSS. His menu and footer formatting changes from page to page when it should be consistent throughout. Furthermore, There
            is not enough whitespace separating his paragraphs from their respective headings. Overall, I believe he has a great website that can become better
            by focusing on the formatting aspect.
