            <ul>
                <li>Home page
                    <ul>
                        <li>The teal and yellow backgrounds are really bright for my eyes so I dislike looking at the website.</li>
                        <li>Link to consulting firm has incorrect file path.</li>
                        <li>Errors found when clicking on HTML button.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>About Us, Pricing and Deals, and Contact Us are currently just placeholders that are still missing content,
                    however, so far I can say they have the proper formatting from the style page.
                </li>
                <li>Photo Gallery
                    <ul>
                        <li>The photo gallery has good functionality with the previous and next buttons, however the values should be
                            adjusted to allow for faster sliding between images.
                        </li>
                        <li>Aside from the concerns I brought, a bit of cleaning up the css and i think this page will look good.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, while i would have chosen different colors,I belive the design of the website is pretty cool.
                The menu is located at the left of the screen and stays in the same screen space regardless of scrolling which
                is a very nice feature to have. Some of the content of the website is still missing so I cannot review it too deeply.
                However, so far he has some great functionality.
