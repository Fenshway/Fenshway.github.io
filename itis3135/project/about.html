        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Racing to Heaven is dedicated to foster the sport of sailing through the message of the Lord. Our mission is to promote and administer international, 
            national and regional sailing events in the Neuse River and the coastal waters of Eastern North Carolina, as well as provide educational opportunities for sailors of all skill levels.
        </p>
        <p>The boat we are primarily sailing on  is an X Yachts Xp 50 built in 2013. For our more serious races, we generally prefer to run a 7-8 person crew. As of now, we average between
            a 5-7 person crew meaing we are actively seeking new members.. We currently have an open position for a grinder, however, we will accept any skilled sailer who would like to become an integral member of our crew.
            While we are looking for dedicated sailors for our core team, we offer community lessons to families as we believe sailing can become a constructive hobby for children and teenagers that may help them
            grow as individuals.
