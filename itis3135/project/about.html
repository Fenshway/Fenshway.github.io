                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The Oriental Presbyterian Sailing Organization has been operating since 2013. We are dedicated to foster the sport of sailing through our community.
                    Our mission is to promote and administer international, national and regional sailing events in the Neuse River and the coastal waters of Eastern North Carolina, 
                    as well as provide educational opportunities for sailors of all skill levels. While we are primarily interested in those who want to take part in sailboat racing,
                    we often host fun activities for the community. If not community? If you are interseted in joining our organization,
                    please apply today!</p>

                    <h3>More About Us</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            While we are looking for dedicated sailors for our core team, we offer community lessons to families as we believe sailing can become a constructive hobby for children and teenagers that may help them
                            grow as individuals. You do not need to have any sailing experience or plan to be on the race team at any point in the future. If you are interested in just joining our community, please specify
                            on the application form. We look forward to hearing from you!
                        </p>

                    <h3>Primary Racing Boat</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>A couple guys in the organization have sailboats we take out from time to time but the boat we primarily race with is an X Yachts Xp 50 built in 2013. 
                            We generally prefer to run an 9 person crew and can run as many as 12 on the boat at a time for our races in case one or two of the sailers need to call out. As of now, we only managed to have sport 
                            a crew of 6 for each of the last 2 races. Due to this, we are recruting to expand our sailing team. We hope you consider joining our community.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>We accept sailers of any skill level. For experienced sailers, you can fill in some of the more experience positons while our entry level sailors will start
                            as rail meat while you learn the ropes.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Community Events</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>For weekends in which there is not a sailing event, we often put together a communtity event. These events range from</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teaching kids how to sail</li>
                            <li>Brunch on the water</li>
                            <li>Fishing</li>
                            <li>Cooking classes</li>
                            <li>Woodworking</li>
                            <li>Standup paddleboarding</li>
                            <li>And many more to come!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For some of the events, we take advantage of hobbies and/or skills that sailers may have. For example, Rob has been woodworking 
                            for 20 years so we thought it would be cool to host woodworking classes (free of charge) from time to time.
