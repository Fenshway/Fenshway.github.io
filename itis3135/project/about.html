                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>The Oriental Presbyterian Sailing Organization has been operating since 2013. We are dedicated to foster the sport of sailing through by building a strong community.
                    Our mission is to promote and administer international, national and regional sailing events in the Neuse River and the coastal waters of Eastern North Carolina, 
                    as well as provide educational opportunities for sailors of all skill levels. While we are primarily interested in those who want to take part in sailboat racing and events,
                    we also host fun activities for the community. After all, how fulfulling can life be without community? If you are interested in joining our organization,
                    please consider applying today!</p>

                    <h3>More About Us</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            While we are looking for dedicated sailors for our core team, we also offer community lessons to families as we believe sailing can become a constructive hobby for 
                            children and teenagers that may help them grow as individuals. You do not need to have any sailing experience or plan to be on the race team at any point in the future. 
                            If you are interested in joining our organization but do not wish to take part in sailing events, please specify on the application form. We look forward to hearing from you!

                    <h3>Primary Racing Boat</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>A couple guys in the organization have sailboats we take out from time to time but the boat we primarily race with is an X Yachts Xp 50 built in 2013. We generally prefer to run 
                            an 9 person crew and can run as many as 12 on the boat at a time for our races in case one or two of the sailers need to call out. As of now, we only managed to have sport 
                            a crew of 6 for each of the last 2 races. Due to this, we are recruting to expand our sailing team. If you would like to be a part of the team, specify in the application form.
                            Please be honest about your sailing experience as it may have no effect on whether we accept you as a member. We are very willing to teach an enthusiastic person the art of sailing.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>We accept sailers of any skill level. For experienced sailers, you can fill in some of the more experience positons while our entry level sailors will start
                            as rail meat while you we teach you the ropes.

                    <h3>Community Events</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>For weekends in which there is not a sailing event, we often host communtity events. These events range from</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teaching kids and teenagers how to sail</li>
                            <li>Brunch on the water</li>
                            <li>Fishing</li>
                            <li>Cooking classes</li>
                            <li>Woodworking</li>
                            <li>Standup paddleboarding</li>
                            <li>And many more to come!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For some of the events, we take advantage of hobbies and/or skills that sailers may have. For example, Rob has been woodworking 
                            for 20 years so we thought it would be cool to host woodworking classes (free of charge) from time to time.
