        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <h3><a href = "https://www.nordstrom.com/">Good Website</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Great contrast. Honestly a white background with black text is objectively good.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Certain categories repeat such as menswear but not in an obnoxious way.</li>
            <li>Allignment: The allignment of everything is perfect and pleasing to look at</li>
            <li>Proximity: The website does a great job addressing proximity. Everything on this website is 
                spaced properly which leads to an easy viewing experience.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a href = "https://www.lingscars.com/">Bad Website</a></h3>&nbsp;
        <div>I assume this website is bad intentionally, however it is still a great example.</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The contrast is not horrible. However, the background art is difficult to look at.</li>
            <li>Repetition: I've seen Ling's face far too many times within the past 20 seconds of writing this.</li>
            <li>Allignment: Alignment is not horrible. The main problem is with the vast amount of stuff on my screen</li>
            <li>Proximity: There is way too much on my screen. I see a million different options
                all jumbled up together and it makes me want to leave the website.</li>
